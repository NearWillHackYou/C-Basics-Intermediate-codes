# C-Basics-Intermediate-codes

I love coding, and I started a month ago learning c# because someday i want to be a recognized programmer and make things for people to use it and enjoy it.
I am currently still learning c# and i consider myself not begginer, but an intermediate programmer using c# language. I post new codes whenever i make one.
